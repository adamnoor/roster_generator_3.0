# stack_generator

Roster Generator is a program that allows users to select players they think will perform well in Draft Kings and create all of the valid rosters that include those players.  Once all of the rosters are generated, the user is walked through a process of restricting the list of rosters by either including or excluding players until the list managable, giving the user a good number of options to chose from.  The script also allows the user to add projection data from Fantasy Focus to help aid in the decision.

To run the script, run the main.py file.  

A requirement is that the input_files folder must contain two files: players.csv and projections.csv.  Provided in the input_files folder are three sample files that can be used to populate the players.csv file. By default, the players.csv file is populated with the small data set and a projection.csv file by default is populated with data aligned to match all of the given data sets with some missing data to show how the program functions when players cannot be found.
